my own ducomnent explain:

- the project design to 'xl' screen (>1536px) & mobile screen (412px X 915px)

1. the form isn't work perfectly generic

   - i didnt used external component for Input fileds (because of issue with pass 'formik' as a proop)
   - validate parameter on submit - i didnt use the 'power' of Formik, did it menually - i need more time to learn and improve my functionality with Formik
   - error / success - by alert()

3. footer - appears only on 'xl' screen

4. change language - the data fetched to the form does not include text in English
   - contace us fetched data does not include text in English
